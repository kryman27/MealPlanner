# MealPlanner

MealPlanner is simple project which has a two main purposes: first of them is to implement planning daily meals logic into web application, second is to establish demo project.
Currently, the logic of application's backend (calculations, database, etc.) is modeled in MS Excel file (will be provided in documentation later). The goal is to reproduce calculations and behavior in WebAPI application,
and then present data in web application (Blazor).

Plans for the nearest future:
  - SQL Database check and corrections (add tables, establish relations between tables);
  - Create endpoints for adding products categories and brands
  - Testing endpoints
  - Blazor frontend development and cleanup (e.g. remove template's items from the app)
